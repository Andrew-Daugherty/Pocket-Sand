\# Pocket Sand!



Pocket Sand is a lightweight Forge mod for Minecraft that introduces a new item: the Pile of Sand.



When killed, Husk mobs drop Piles of Sand. Four piles can be crafted into one Sand block, and a Sand block can also be broken back down into four Piles of Sand. In addition, the Pile of Sand item can be thrown like a snowball to temporarily blind enemies for 3 seconds.



This mod makes Sand a renewable resource and adds a tactical use for it in combat.
